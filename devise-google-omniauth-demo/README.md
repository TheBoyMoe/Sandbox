Rails 5 app built to investigate authentication and authorisation in techniques.
- Devise provided user authentication
- omniauth-google  allowed authentication via a 3rd party
- Petergate - provided user authorisation

The Bootstrap and Fontawesome gems were added to provide the styles and icons respectively. The Devise error messages were customised to fit into the bootstrap alert styles.
