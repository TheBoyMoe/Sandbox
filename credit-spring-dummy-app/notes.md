The technical interview tries to simulate our daily work, by implementing a new feature on a given app.

In order to simulate real life work, you can take your time to think of a proper solution.
Therefore, we'll structure this in 2 parts:
1 - App study, on your own
The app can be found at https://github.com/dncrht/dummy
It's a very simple app, that allows to register and login. Please read the README document.
Explore the codebase, install it locally, play with it in your browser.
The feature we want you to implement is to change the sign-up logic such that only a list of approved users will be able to register.


Example:

Given a user with email a@a.com
and the approved users list being a@a.com, b@b.com, and c@c.com
the app will accept the registration for a@a.com
the app will reject the registration for z@z.com
2 - Actual coding of the solution, in a pairing session
During the pairing interview session please:
Explain how you want to approach the problem. Imagine that we are in a planning session and we are discussing the feature with the other stakeholders.
Implement the solution to the above exercise. Think out loud
Explain any of the technical tradeoffs you find
Feel free to ask any question, or ask for help. Remember: it's a pairing session.


We look for:

Team/cultural fit
Proficiency with the tools we use: Rails, RSpec, Github
Challenging questions
